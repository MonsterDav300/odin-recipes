    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Flank steak is a flavorful cut of beef taken from the abdominal muscles of the cow, known for its distinctive
        grain and robust taste. Best when marinated and cooked quickly over high heat, it is often sliced thinly against
        the grain to enhance its tenderness and served in dishes like fajitas, salads, or simply on its own.
